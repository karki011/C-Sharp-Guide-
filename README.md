## What is OOP?
#### OOP stands for "Object-Oriented Programming". It is a Programming methodology based on objects, instead of just functions and procedures. In other words, itâ€™s a programming style which is concepts of class, object and various other concepts like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation, etc. There are four principles of OOP:
1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object in generally hidden from outside of the object's definition. It also leads to data hiding. Main benefits of Encapsulation is that it can reduce system complexity.
2. **Abstraction**: The general definition would be showcasing only the required things outsides meaning hiding details from outside world. Data Abstraction is nothing more than the implementation of an objects that contains the same essential properties and action we can find in the original object we are representing.
3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a way to reuse code by existing objects. Inheritance enables new class to receive or inherit the properties and methods of existing class. Inheritance is concept child class can inherits  its functionality of parents class.
4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism means one name, many forms. Polymorphism manifests itself by having multiple methods all with same name, but slightly different functionality. There are 2 basic types of Polymorphism:
  1. **Overriding** also called run time Polymorphism. For method
  2. **Overloading**, methods is when the complier determines which methods will be executed, and this decision is made when the gets complied.
#### If you can grasp these four principles, OOP can be breeze for you.
